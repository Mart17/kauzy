The parliament elections are held in my home country, Slovakia, every four years and there is a lot of bad stuff that politicians and other public figures have done. It was that much that I have easily lost track of it. Hence, I have decided to create this tool that would help people like me search for public figures, and see what cases they might be connected to so that I can make informed decisions.

My vision for this project is very simple - create an environment for someone (either organization, co-author, activist) that would fill up the app with data. I have no intentions of writing very own content, instead, I would love the app to link from cases screen to various media from the country.

Goals:
1. Create an app that every country could use to increase the awareness of its citizens.
2. Keep this solution apolitical.

## Key Features

- Manage the list of public figures (e.g. politicians).
- Manage the list of cases. Assign public figures to the cases.
- Attach internet links to the cases so that people can read more.

## Technology Stack

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Tailwindcss
- Webpacker
- RSpec
